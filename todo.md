# Personal Portfolio Implementation Plan

## Files to create:

1. `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Replace the existing Index page with the provided ZQPortfolioMinimal component
2. `index.html` - Update the title and metadata
3. `public/assets/` - Create folder structure for images (images will need to be provided by the user)

## Implementation Details:

- The main component (ZQPortfolioMinimal) will be implemented in the Index.tsx file
- The portfolio uses Tailwind CSS which is already configured in the template
- The image paths are set to reference files in the public/assets directory

## Note:

All image files referenced in the code should be placed in the public/assets directory:
